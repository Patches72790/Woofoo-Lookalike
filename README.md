# Woofoo-Lookalike
Wufoo is a form building website that we have new devs replicate (in some sense) as a test project to make sure there is an understanding of React and Redux and how to use each appropriately.

For this test project, we recommend using Create React App to get a local environment running as quickly as possible, but if you want to reinvent the wheel you are more than welcome to.

The basic requirements of the project are:
●	Written in ReactJS
●	Uses Redux
●	Functionality of Wufoo
○	Adding different inputs to form
○	Removing different inputs from forms
○	Saving of forms
○	Reloading of forms
●	Any other improvements you can think of

Extra Credit:
●	Drag and drop functionality
●	Editing of inputs
●	Steal Wufoo’s stylesheet

If you have any questions or concerns, let us know! We’re here to help. We don’t care how it looks as long as it's organized and our eyes don’t bleed when we look at it.

Party on!
